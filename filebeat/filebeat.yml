################### Filebeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Filebeat ######################################
filebeat:
  # List of prospectors to fetch data.
  prospectors:
    # Each - is a prospector. Below are the prospector specific configurations
    -
      # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
      # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
      # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
      # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
      # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
      paths:
        - /var/log/logstash/logstash.log
      # - c:\programdata\elasticsearch\logs\*

      # Configure the file encoding for reading file with international characters
      # supported encodings:
      #   plain, utf-8, utf-16be-bom, utf-16be, utf-16le, big5, gb18030, gbk, hzgb2312,
      #   euckr, eucjp, iso2022jp, shiftjis, iso8859-63, iso8859-6i, iso8859-8e,
      #   iso8859-8i
      #encoding: plain

      # Type of the files. Based on this the way the file is read is decided.
      # The different types cannot be mixed in one prospector
      #
      # Possible options are:
      # * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
      # * stdin: Reads the standard in
      type: log

      # Optional additional fields. These field can be freely picked
      # to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering
      #fields:
      #  level: debug
      #  review: 1

      # Ignore files which were modified more then the defined timespan in the past
      # Time strings like 2h (2 hours), 5m (5 minutes) can be used.
      #ignore_older:

      # Scan frequency in seconds.
      # How often these files should be checked for changes. In case it is set
      # to 0s, it is done as often as possible. Default: 10s
      #scan_frequency: 10s

      # Defines the buffer size every harvester uses when fetching the file
      #harvester_buffer_size: 16384

      # Always tail on log rotation. Disabled by default
      # Note: This may skip entries
      #tail_on_rotate: false

    #-
    #  paths:
    #    - /var/log/apache/*.log
    #  type: log
    #
    #  # Ignore files which are older then 24 hours
    #  ignore_older: 24h
    #
    #  # Additional fields which can be freely defined
    #  fields:
    #    type: apache
    #    server: localhost
    #-
    #  type: stdin
    #  paths:
    #    - "-"

  # General filebeat configuration options
  #
  # Event count spool threshold - forces network flush if exceeded
  #spool_size: 1024

  # Defines how often the spooler is flushed. After idle_timeout the spooler is
  # Flush even though spool_size is not reached.
  #idle_timeout: 5s

  # Name of the registry file. Per default it is put in the current working
  # directory. In case the working directory is changed after when running
  # filebeat again, indexing starts from the beginning again.
  registry_file: /var/lib/filebeat/registry

  # Full Path to directory with additional prospector configuration files. Each file must end with .yml
  # These config files must have the full filebeat config part inside, but only
  # the prospector part is processed. All global options like spool_size are ignored.
  # The config_dir MUST point to a different directory then where the main filebeat config file is in.

############################# Output ##########################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by filebeat.
# You can enable one or multiple outputs by setting enabled option to true.
output:

  ### Elasticsearch as output
  # elasticsearch:

    # Set to true to enable elasticsearch output
    # enabled: true

    # Array of hosts to connect to.
    # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
    # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
    # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200

    # [filebeat-]YYYY.MM.DD keys.
    #index: "filebeat"

    # Optional HTTP Path
    #path: "/elasticsearch"

    # The number of times a particular Elasticsearch index operation is attempted. If
    # the indexing operation doesn't succeed after this many retries, the events are
    # dropped. The default is 3.

    # requests are made.
